[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/1124300911574003732?logo=discord&label=Discord&color=%235865f2)](https://discord.gg/hZwbVSDkhy)

[Kando](https://github.com/kando-menu/kando) comes with several built-in themes.
This repository contains additional themes that you can use with Kando.
You can easily [create your own theme](https://kando.menu/create-menu-themes/)!
If you created something cool, feel free to share it with the community by opening a pull request.

To install a theme, simply download this repository and copy the directory of the theme you want to use into the `menu-themes` directory of your Kando installation.
Depending on your platform, the `menu-themes` directory is located at:

- <img height="14" width="26" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Windows_logo_-_2021_%28Black%29.svg" /> Windows: `%appdata%\kando\menu-themes\`
- <img height="14" width="26" src="https://cdn.simpleicons.org/apple" /> macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/kando/menu-themes/`
- <img height="14" width="26" src="https://cdn.simpleicons.org/linux/black" /> Linux: `~/.config/kando/menu-themes/`

Afterwards, you will have to restart Kando, and then you can select the new theme in the settings.

> [!TIP]
> You can also join the [Kando Discord server](https://discord.gg/hZwbVSDkhy) to share your themes and get help with creating them!

| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| [**EVNTech Vache**](./themes/evntech-vache/)<br>Mix of Nether Lables and default theme.                                                                                                                                                                                                  | ![preview](./themes/evntech-vache/preview.jpg)        | [Download](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/yar2000T/menu-themes/tree/main/themes/evntech-vache)                                                          |
| [**Hexperiment**](./themes/hexperiment/)<br>A very experimental theme. It only works up to 6 items. Also, if you have fewer, you should ensure that all items are arranged in the six cardinal directions. Otherwise, the menu will look weird.                                          | ![preview](./themes/hexperiment/preview.jpg)          |
| [**KnightForge**](./themes/knight-forge/)<br>This theme combines style and compactness!                                                                                                                                                                                                  | ![preview](./themes/knight-forge/preview.jpg)         |
| [**Minecraft**](./themes/minecraft)<br>This theme mimics the aesthetics of this well-known computer game. To get the most out of it, it is recommended to use a pixelated icon theme such as [pixelitos](https://github.com/ItzSelenux/pixelitos-icon-theme)!                            | ![preview](./themes/minecraft/preview.jpg)            |
| [**Modified Bent Photon**](./themes/modified-bent-photon/)<br>A variation of the original [Bent Photon Theme](https://github.com/NeighNeighNeigh/Kando_Themes) by NeighNeighNeigh.                                                                                                       | ![preview](./themes/modified-bent-photon/preview.jpg) |
| [**Nether Labels**](./themes/nether-labels/)<br>With its dark and classy colors, this theme features labels on your items and submenus and a sleek overall appearance. If, however, you're style is more bright or flashy, you can fully customize this theme with its 10 colors options. | ![preview](./themes/nether-labels/preview.jpg)        |
| [**Nord**](./themes/nord/)<br>Clone of Nether Labels theme with Nord color palette.                                                                                                                                                                                                      | ![preview](./themes/nord/preview.jpg)                 |
