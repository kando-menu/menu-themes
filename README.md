[Kando](https://github.com/kando-menu/kando) comes with several built-in themes.
This repository contains additional themes that you can use with Kando.
You can easily [create your own theme](https://kando.menu/create-menu-themes/)!
If you created something cool, feel free to share it with the community by opening a pull request.

To install a theme, simply download this repository and copy the directory of the theme you want to use into the `menu-themes` directory of your Kando installation.
Depending on your platform, the `menu-themes` directory is located at:

- <img height="14" width="26" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Windows_logo_-_2021_%28Black%29.svg" /> Windows: `%appdata%\kando\menu-themes\`
- <img height="14" width="26" src="https://cdn.simpleicons.org/apple" /> macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/kando/menu-themes/`
- <img height="14" width="26" src="https://cdn.simpleicons.org/linux/black" /> Linux: `~/.config/kando/menu-themes/`

Afterwards, you will have to restart Kando, and then you can select the new theme in the settings.

> You can also join the [Kando Discord server](https://discord.gg/hZwbVSDkhy) to share your themes and get help with creating them!
